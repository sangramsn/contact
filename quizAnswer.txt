#code : 1
In this case, Code 2 is a better way to code the component. 
The key difference between the two code blocks is the placement of the onClick event handler.

<div onClick={handleClick}>
  {animals.map((animal) => {
    return <div>{animal}</div>;
  })}
</div>


In Code 1, the onClick event is added to the outer div that wraps all the animal elements. 
This means that clicking anywhere inside the div will trigger the event. 
However, this approach does not provide a clear indication of which animal was clicked. 
You would need to inspect the e.target.innerHTML to determine the clicked animal.



#code : 2 
<div>
  {animals.map((animal) => {
    return <div onClick={handleClick}>{animal}</div>;
  })}
</div>
In Code 2, the onClick event is added to each individual animal div. 
This approach associates the event handler directly with the animal being rendered. 
When an animal is clicked, the event handler is invoked, and you can clearly see which animal was clicked.
 This makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand.

So, Code 2 is the better way to code the component because it provides a more intuitive and clear interaction for the user by attaching the event handler to each animal element.
